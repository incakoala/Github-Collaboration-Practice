### Vy Thai

Degree: Master of Development Engineering

I have academic backgrounds in both international affairs/social sciences and computer science, having worked as a software engineer at a K-12 edtech company in SF the past couple of years. My interests lie in the intersection of data science, sociology, and urban planning. Specifically I'm interested in using data to gain deeper insights into how cultures, societies, public policies, and post-colonialism and post-war inform and shape urban issues faced by marginalized communities in my native Vietnam and locally in the Bay Area where I've called home the past five years.
